# Program
My effort to write Python programs.
The first program is the solution to exercise 8 of Chapter "Loops and Conditional" of the "Introduction to Programming with Python" book.
The question is that:
Generalizing the "uniform random numbers" exercise from Section 1.2, compose a program that accepts an integer n as a command-line argument, uses random.random() to write n uniform random numbers between 0 and 1, and then writes their average value, their minimum value, and their maximum value.
